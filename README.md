# Trichodesmium_HetR
Scripts for the publication 'Sub-population Red Sea metagenomes challenge the use of morphology and marker genes to assess Trichodesmium diversity.'

The raw sequencing reads from the metagenomic study were deposited at NCBI under the BioProject PRJNA804487. The 4 assembled Trichodesmium MAGs can be found at NCBI under the accession numbers JAKQYD000000000 (MAG R01), JAKQYE000000000 (MAG R02), JAKQYF000000000 (MAG R03), JAKQYG000000000 (MAG R04). 

In this despository - the script to process the metagenomic data is given, including the four Trichodesmium MAGS from this study in FASTA format (MAG_R-X), and the HetR fasta files (in one text file) that were used for phylogenetic analysis.
