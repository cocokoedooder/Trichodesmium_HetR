Scripts for the publication 'Sub-population metagenomes from the Red Sea challenge the use of morphology and marker genes to assess Trichodesmium diversity.'

In this despository - the script to process the metagenomic data is given, including the four Trichodesmium MAGS from this study in FASTA format, and the HetR fasta files (in one text file) that were used for phylogenetic analysis.
