# Trichodesmium_HetR
Scripts for the publication 'Sub-population Red Sea metagenomes challenge the use of morphology and marker genes to assess Trichodesmium diversity.'

Trichodesmium colonies were colleted of three distinct morphotypes. The data for this manuscript can be found in Bioproject PRJNA804487 - and concerns the following 3 Metagenomic Biosamples: SPC - dense puffs (SAMN25753496 / SRR17940154); LPC - thin puffs (SAMN25753497 / SRR17940155 ); and TSC - tufts (SAMN25753498 / SRR17940156). From these biosamples - we discuss 4 metagenomic-assembled genomes (Trichodesmium sp) - MAG_R01 (SAMN25809967), MAG_R02 (SAMN25809968), MAG_R03 (SAMN25809969), and MAG_R04 (SAMN25809970).  

In this despository - the script to process the metagenomic data is given, including the four Trichodesmium MAGS from this study in FASTA format (MAG_R-X), and the HetR fasta files (in one text file) that were used for phylogenetic analysis.
